SETUP:

The setup process works like this:
$ guix pull
$ cd guix-bioinformatics && git pull
# systemctl enable --now bnw.service

for testing changes to the container, you'll want to do the following (or thereabouts):
$ guix system container gn/servicebnwN1-container.scm --network
$ sudo -E $(guix system container gn/services/bnw-container.scm --network)

for running the service:
see included bnw.service

for upgrades:
$ guix pull
$ cd guix-bioinformatics && git pull
# systemctl restart bnw.service
